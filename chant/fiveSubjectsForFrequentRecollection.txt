I am of the nature to age; I have not gone beyond aging.
I am of the nature to sicken; I have not gone beyond sickness.
I am of the nature to die; I have not gone beyond dying.
All that is mine, beloved and pleasing, will become otherwise; will become separated from me.
I am the owner of my karma, heir to my karma, born of my karma, related to my karma, abide supported by my karma.
Whatever karma I shall do, for good or for ill, of that I shall be the heir.
Thus we should frequently recollect.
